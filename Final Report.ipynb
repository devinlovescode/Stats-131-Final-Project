Today’s summer Olympic Games includes 33 sports with 400 events, and the winter Olympic Games includes 16 sports with 98 different events. The Olympics are held every four years with the Summer and Winter Olympics alternating every two years. \n\nTheir creation was inspired by the ancient Olympic Games, which were held in Olympia, Greece, from the 8th century BC to the 4th century AD. In 1894, Baron Pierre de Coubertin founded the International Olympic Committee (IOC), the governing body of the Olympic Movement, with the Olympic Charter defining its structure and authority.\n\nThe first Olympics was held in 1896, which most closely resembled today’s summer Olympics. Throughout the 20th and 21st century, the Olympics evolved. In 1924, the winter Olympic games were added. Over the years, many older sports/events i.e. tug of war, polo, and croquet as well as still popular sports such as baseball, softball, lacrosse, and cricket to name a few have been phased out. The games had to adjust to political and economic shifts. The Olympic games of 1912, 1940, and 1944 were canceled due to World War I and II. The Olympic games have been the center of conspiracies, boycotts, doping scandals, bribery, sabotage, and even a terrorist attack. Additionally, there was a shift in allowing professional players to participate in the Olympics. For many years only amateur people were allowed to compete. Now, the games have grown to the point that the IOC endorse the paralympics, junior olympics, and every nation is now represented today. Also the media popularity surrounding the Olympics give athletes and/or the city hosting the event the opportunity to become nationally and sometimes internationally famous. \n\nThe First Olympic games only had 14 countries and only 9 sports. Today the Olympics are held every 4 years, and it encompasses almost every country and every professional sport. There are only 16 countries that do not participate i.e. Somaliland (Internationally unrecognized country), Macau (an autonomous region of China), Tahiti (Territory of France), and some sports that are not played i.e. Chess, Bowling, Surfing.\n\n### Common knowledge shared among Olympics fans. \n* The Winter and Summer Olympics used to be held at the same time until 1992. They were staggered to happen two years apart, both on even years. They were staggered to better promote the sports in the Winter Olympics.\n\n* The 2020 Olympics are going to be held in Tokyo and will be the first one that will be available to watch anywhere in the world through holograms.\n\n* Women were not allowed to compete in 1896 but were allowed to compete afterward.\n\n* Between 1912-1948, artists such as painters, sculptors and musicians competed in their respective fields.\n\n* The Olympic flame is carried to all participating countries before the games and is supposed to be lit throughout the games.\n\n* The Symbol represents the 5 inhabited landmasses of the world which are :\n    -Blue: Europe\n    -Yellow: Asia\n    -Black: Africa\n    -Green: Australia\n    -Red: North and South America\n\n### Narrowing Scope\nAs a result of a large number of events and changes the Olympic committee has gone over, we have decided to focus on four sports and analyzing the events that have taken place after 1994. The four Sport-Events we have decided to focus on are:\n\n#### Table Tennis\nOne player serves the ball by tossing it at least six inches high, striking the ball with the paddle so that it bounces on his/her own side of the table, then the opponent's side of the table. The receiver must return the ball by hitting it back over the net before the ball bounces a second time on his/her side of the table.\n\nThe two players alternate returning the ball until one player misses their shot, by missing the ball completely, hitting the ball onto their side of the table, hitting the ball into the net, etc. Players alternate serving every two points, regardless of who won the point. The winner of a game is the first player to 11 points, with a lead of at least 2 points. So, if the score is 10-10, the game goes into deuce, where players now alternate serving every point. After each game, players switch table sides. Matches are usually played best of 7, so the first player to win 4 games wins.\n\nTable tennis is relatively new as an Olympic sport, having started in 1988. China has historically been extremely dominant in table tennis, to the point where they changed the format in 2012 so that only two competitors per country could enter an event, preventing China from winning all three medals in a category (which they did in both Men's Singles and Women's Singles in Beijing 2008). China has won 28 gold medals in table tennis. The second place country is South Korea, which has won 3 gold medals in table tennis. Table tennis is one of the few Olympic sports that the USA has never medaled in.\n\n#### Swimming Events: 100 meters\nSwimming requires a lot of athleticism and technique. The one hundred meter swim requires a great exertion of energy very quickly. There are four types of 100-meter swimming competitions. Each type requires competitors to swim in the competitions respective forms: breaststroke, freestyle, backstroke, and butterfly. Typically, competitors are best at one rarely two types of swimming forms. \n\nSwimmers start outside of the water on the platform called a starting block. All of them are on the same side of the pool. An alarm signals the start of the race. The swimmers dive into the water to start the race. Swimmers are not allowed to dive into the water before the alarm or its considered a false start. They must swim to either side of the pool and make contact with the pool wall. Swimming across the pool and touching one side is considered a lap. The first competitor to swim two laps the fastest wins. \n\n<img src=\"Screen Shot 2018-12-10 at 8.21.55 PM\"/>\n\nThese times were calculated using the final Olympic competitor times from the 2016 Rio Olympics. The lower and upper bounds were calculated by calculating the mean and adding/subtracting one sample standard deviation of the times.\n\n\n#### Figure Skating\nFigure skating is a sport that focuses on the manipulation of the skater's body weight and balance as they attempt several different elements such as jumps, spins, lifts (for pairs), intricate footwork and turns. Figure skating is usually done inside on an ice rink which allowed it to be present at all Summer Olympic events up until 1992. This also made the sport accessible year-round for training and competition for many countries. Music for these programs historically was limited to instrumental only, however, this has very recently been changed by the International Skating Union(ISU) beginning in 2014. Typically skaters choose their own music for their programs. The age requirement for figure skating changes by the ISU, but generally starts at a very early age (12 to 15 years old). Most figure skaters retire fairly early too, usually before they reach 30 due to it being a very difficult and demanding competitive sport.\n\nFigure Skating Competitions have two parts: a \"short program\" which lasts two minutes and fifty seconds and a \"long program\" (also called free skate) that lasts four minutes and thirty seconds. The short program compromises of a set of elements that a skater must complete, testing their technique and ability to perform certain types of jumps, spins, steps, or more of varying difficulties. The long program gives the skater more freedom for their routine and is focused around performance. For the singles events, there is a limit of 30 participants. Countries can earn up to 3 teams per event, depending on their skaters' placement in the most recent World Figure Skating Championships. Most of the spots are taken in this fashion, but there are other tournaments that could earn entries as well (Nebelhorn Trophy competition).\n\nFigure Skating used to be judged on a 6.0 scale. This scale included 3 elements: technical merit(long program), required elements(short program), and presentation(both). Each judge would score separately from each other for each program and then combined them to rank the skaters. However, it has been changed in due to a scandal at the 2002 Winter Olympics Pairs Event due to suspected biased scoring for the gold and silver medalists. It has since been changed to the ISU Judging System (IJS). This system is significantly more complex, including a technical panel for unbiased identification of skating elements, a referee, and a judging panel consisting of 9 people that grade using a combination of Program Component Scores (PCS), and Grade of Execution (GOE). Both of these scoring rubrics are specific on evaluations, and with a combined weighted score, skaters are then ranked. Men at the Olympics score in the mid to high 200's, sometimes getting above 300 (85-100 in short program, 180-200 in long program). Women at the same level of expertise score in the low 200's due to different scaling and the lack of quad's (4 revolutions in their jumps), which score very highly if done correctly, compared to the men's competition.\n\n#### Track and Field: 100 meters\nThe starting blocks are set by the runners (usually 30 minutes before their competition).\nThere are usually 2 heats, 1 quarterfinal,1 semi-final, and 1 final race. The Lanes are assigned by the athletes’ times in the qualifying rounds. The fastest times get lanes closer to the center. In the first heat, lanes are decided by previous run times of the athletes.2 Athletes with the best time move on to the next stage. In the final stage, the top 3 are awarded the medals. If there is a tie, both are awarded medals. Athletes run across the straight region of the 400m track. The Winner is determined by the first person to have their torso cross the finish line.\n\n In comparison to other track events, the 100m is the one with the least distance, therefore, making the start in this race very important. Recent rules have no false starts(starting to run before the starting gun). If someone is given a false start they are automatically disqualified. Before 2010, runners were allowed 1 false start. Another way of being disqualified is to cross into another lane. \n\nThe Best times are held by Usain Bolt (9.58 seconds) who happens to be the tallest and heaviest Olympic competitor for this event, in history. It is mostly calculated by sports scientists that 9.57 seconds is the fastest any person can run a 100m. \n\nAll people have fast twitch muscle fibers and slow twitch muscle fibers. Sprinters(Athletes who run 100m,200m) have a higher concentration of fast- twitch muscle fibers and are also usually taller and much stronger. Long Distance athletes (3000m and above) tend to have more slow twitch muscle fibers. They tend to be much thinner. Middle distance athletes somewhere in the middle in mix of muscle fibers and body structure. Most Sprinters are between 69 - 73 inches weighing between 160 - 190 pounds. Usain Bolt is 77 inches tall weighing 207 pounds is definitely an anomaly. \n\n\n## Data Discussion\nThe dataset is divided into athletes events and NOC regions. \n\n**Athletes Events Dataset**\n<img src=\"Screen Shot 2018-12-10 at 8.27.52 PM.png\"/>\n\n**NOC Regions**\n<img src=\"Screen Shot 2018-12-10 at 8.29.39 PM.png\"/>\n\n\n### Data Source and Collection\nThe data was compiled by Randi H Griffin who posted it on Kaggle. He web scraped it from www.sports-reference.com and the data is for public use on Kaggle. The data from Sports Reference was compiled for every year starting since April 2000  and the data before was found by Sports Reference using historical records. In April 2000  the information was uploaded to the website. The information is updated after every Olympic Games leading up to 2016. The dataset was posted before 2018, thus it does not cover the 2018 Winter Olympics.\n\n### Choices about the Data\nThe data we chose was a subset of the total data starting at 1994 and ending in 2016. 1994 was chosen since many countries did not participate in most events prior. 1994 onwards saw a boost in participation from countries. 1994 was also a good choice since there were countries newly formed(Eritrea) or countries that fell(USSR) prior to 1994. 2016 was the latest data available in the dataset.\n\nThe variables most important to our research were the Year, Team, Medal, and Event. Other variables had information that was already provided in our chosen variables(e.g NOC region, Games). Other variables were not considered as they would not have a big impact across all sports or there might be other variables that were more important. These include height, weight, and age. At the Olympic level variables such as skill level, experience or other physical attributes might give athletes a bigger edge.\n",

When comparing the 25th and 75th percentile for height we see that there is only a 8cm difference whereas with weight that is 11kgs. It shows that most winners are close in height but could have a huge difference in weight. They are also very close in age only being between 22 and 26.
